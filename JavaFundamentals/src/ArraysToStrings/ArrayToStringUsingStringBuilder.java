    /**
     * Purpose:
     * Convert an array to a string efficiently using StringBuilder.
     * 
     * How It Works:
     * - A StringBuilder is created and each element of the array is appended to it.
     * - Finally, the toString() method of StringBuilder is called to obtain the concatenated string.
     * - This method is efficient because StringBuilder is mutable, meaning it doesnâ€™t create multiple objects during concatenation.
     * 
     * Use Case:
     * - Best for performance-critical applications, especially when dealing with large arrays or performing repetitive operations.
     * - Suitable for any type of array (e.g., int[], char[], String[], etc.).
