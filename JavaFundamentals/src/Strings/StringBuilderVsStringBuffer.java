1. Overview of StringBuilder and StringBuffer
Purpose:
Both StringBuilder and StringBuffer are used to create mutable (modifiable) sequences of characters.
 Unlike String, which is immutable, StringBuilder and StringBuffer allow you to modify the content without creating new objects.
 
When to Use:
Use these classes when you need to perform many modifications (e.g., append, insert, delete) on strings, 
especially in loops or when efficiency is a concern.

2. Key Features
Common Features:
Mutability:
Both StringBuilder and StringBuffer are mutable, meaning you can change the content of the object without creating a new one.

Efficient String Manipulation:
Both classes are designed to handle large amounts of string modifications efficiently, avoiding the overhead of creating 
multiple String objects.

Chaining Methods:
Methods in both StringBuilder and StringBuffer return the same object, allowing you to chain multiple method calls together.

//Difference between StringBuilder and StringBuffer:
//Thread-Safety:
//
//StringBuffer: Thread-safe due to synchronized methods. This makes StringBuffer suitable for use in multithreaded environments
// where multiple threads might access and modify the same instance.
// 
//StringBuilder: Not thread-safe because it lacks synchronized methods. It is generally faster than StringBuffer and 
//is preferred in single-threaded environments.
//
//Performance:
//StringBuilder: Faster due to the lack of synchronization overhead. Use this when you don't need thread safety.
//StringBuffer: Slower compared to StringBuilder because it is synchronized, which adds overhead.

		  /**
		   * 3. Common Methods
Both StringBuilder and StringBuffer have similar methods for manipulating strings:

append(String str): Adds the string representation of the argument to the sequence.
insert(int offset, String str): Inserts the string at the specified offset position.
delete(int start, int end): Removes the characters from the sequence within the specified range.
reverse(): Reverses the character sequence.
toString(): Converts the character sequence to a String.
